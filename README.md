### Notes
* Macros shouldn't be bannable/detectable by EAC, still, use them at your own risk.
* Test the script in a custom match to make sure it's working correctly.
* The script will automatically start/stop with the game and will only work when the game is maximized, as long as the script is running in the background.
* Pressing any key will interrupt the script, make sure not to press any key while pressing the macro key.
